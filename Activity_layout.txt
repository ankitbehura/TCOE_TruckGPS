Activity layout
===============

We will be now listing the activity layout for the app:
	- Indentation implies the contents of the particular activity
	- () specifies what the activity achieves
	
1. Landing page
      (App name + Contributors on some good background)
2. Home page
	  (Safety net. 
	   Single-instance activity which will call other
	   functionalities over it but not kill itself. 
	   Submodule selection happens here and the control diverges
	   from here and all "back"s must converge here)
	- Button 1: Music explorer
	- Button 2: Update Server with GPS co-ordinates
	- Button 3: Update map with crowdsourcing technology
