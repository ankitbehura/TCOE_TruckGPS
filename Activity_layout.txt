Activity layout
===============

We will be now listing the activity layout for the app:
	- Indentation implies the contents of the particular activity
	- * specifies what the activity achieves
	
1. Landing page
       * App name
       * Contributors on some good background
2. Home page
	   * Safety net. 
	   * Single-instance activity which will call other functionalities over it but not kill itself. 
	   * Submodule selection happens here and the control diverges from here and all "back"s must converge here
	->Contents:
	- Button 2: Music explorer
	            Takes you to MusicActivity
	- Button 5: Update Server with GPS co-ordinates
				There will also be a background service which will send the coordinates after prior permission from the user. 
	- Button 6: Update map with crowdsourcing technology
3. Music page
		* Checks if the media folder is specified. If not, we wait for the user to specify the media folder
		* If file not found, appropriate message shown
		- Button 1: Find and play media
				Confirms if the path is correct. Else, clears the database and starts of /
	            The final file on being chosen is passed via an intent to the appropriate music player by using the ubiquitous program picker.
